        <h1>Lyrics</h1>
        <p>Uh</p>
        <p>
        Shawty go jogging every morning (every morning) <br />
        And she make me breakfast almost every morning (every morning) <br />
        And she take a naked pic' before she leave the door <br />
        I be waking up to pics' before a nigga yawning
        </p>
        <p>
        And every weekend my shawty comin' over (over) <br />
        Shawty could Fendi out, but she like Fashion Nova (Nova) <br />
        She ain't driving no Camry, she pullin' in a Rover (Rover) <br />
        With her hair so curly, I love you, baby
        </p>
        <p>
        She said, "What you know 'bout love?" (I'll tell you everything) <br />
        I got what you need (oh) <br />
        Walk up in the store and get what you want (go get it) <br />
        You get what you please <br />
        We 'bout to get it on, take off them drawers (I said I love you, baby) <br />
        It's just you and me <br />
        You know what I be on, I'm about to go raw (love you, baby) <br />
        'Cause I like what I see
        </p>
        <p>
        Look, baby, I said I ain't gon' front <br />
        You got my heart beating so fast to words I can't pronounce <br />
        And I be getting the chills every time I feel your touch <br />
        I be looking at the top and girl, it's only us
        </p>
        <p>
        All I need is your trust <br />
        And girl I told you once, don't make me tell you twice <br />
        I know you see this print through my pants that I know you like <br />
        And yo' ass be looking so fat when it be in them tights <br />
        And I'm going straight to the top, so hope you ain't afraid of heights
        </p>
        <p>
        You always treat me right, for a fact, you never left <br />
        Through all the trials and tribulations, always had my best <br />
        So here's 55 hunnid, go and get your breasts <br />
        Start rubbin' on your butt, start kissing on yo' neck
        </p>
        <p>
        Hey batter, batter, hey batter, batter <br />
        Niggas know I had to swing, I had to make a play <br />
        I had to apply the pressure, 'cause you my hidden treasure <br />
        I think I'm falling in love
        </p>
        <p>
        She said, "What you know 'bout love?" (I'll tell you everything) <br />
        I got what you need (oh) <br />
        Walk up in the store and get what you want (go get it) <br />
        You get what you please <br />
        We 'bout to get it on, take off them drawers (I said I love you, baby) <br />
        It's just you and me <br />
        You know what I be on, I'm about to go raw (love you, baby) <br />
        'Cause I like what I see (oh)
