            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Apex Legends is a free-to-play battle royale-hero shooter game developed by Respawn Entertainment and 
                published by Electronic Arts. It was released for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One in February 2019, 
                for Nintendo Switch in March 2021, and for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in March 2022. A mobile 
                version of the game designed for touchscreens titled Apex Legends Mobile was released in May 2022 on Android 
                and iOS. The game supports cross-platform play, excluding the aforementioned mobile platforms.

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>Before the match, players form into two- or three-player squads, and select from pre-designed characters 
                with distinctive abilities, known as "Legends". The game has two gameplay modes. In "Battle Royale", up 
                to 20 three-person squads or 30 two-person duos land on an island and search for weapons and supplies 
                before attempting to defeat all other players in combat. The available play area on the island shrinks 
                over time, forcing players to keep moving or else find themselves outside the play area which can be fatal. 
                The final team alive wins the round. In "Arenas", players form into three-player squads and fight against another 
                squad in a 3v3 team deathmatch over a series of rounds to determine the winner of the match. Teams win when their 
                team has at least 3 points and is 2 points ahead.
