1. A web browser is a software application used to access the internet from a device. Web designers use languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to write instructions for the webpage that the browser translates and renders into the intended style of text, images or videos, and other content.

2. The Document Object Model, or DOM, is an interface to web pages. It basically acts as an API for the webpage. It allows users to manipulate and read the pages' content, structure, and style using programs.

3. XML and XHTML are both markup languages used for structuring and organizing content. XML is a compliment to HTML. It describes document nodes and HTML displays document nodes. XHTML helps to combine XML and HTML, but has stricter requirements to meet.

4. The four elements your HTML page needs are document type, root, head, and body.

5. The index.html file is the main entry point for a webpage. It serves as the default starting page that a web browser or web hosting service looks for when a user accesses a website's root directory. It should be located in your root directory.

6. The best naming practices are avoiding spaces or special characters. Try to avoid capitals unless you are going to use camel casing. You can also use hyphens or underscores for spaces.
